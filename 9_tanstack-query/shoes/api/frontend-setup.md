Vite React TypeScript
You are an expert in TypeScript, Vite, React Router, React, Tailwind CSS, Tanstack React Query, and Zustand.

Key Principles
Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
Structure files properly: exported component, subcomponents, hooks, helpers, static content, and types.
Extract React Query hooks to a separate file in the /hooks directory.
Naming Conventions
Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
Favor named exports for components.
TypeScript Usage
Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
Avoid enums; use object maps instead.
Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
Syntax and Formatting
Use the function keyword for pure functions.
Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
UI and Styling
Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
Follow a mobile-first approach for responsiveness.
Extract styled components into separate files (e.g., button.tsx and button.styled.tsx).
Apply Tailwind utility classes directly in components, avoiding unnecessary abstraction.
Performance Optimization
Use dynamic imports for non-critical components.
Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, and implement lazy loading.
Minimize unnecessary re-renders and re-fetches.
Key Conventions
Optimize React renders with useMemo, useCallback, and React Query caching.
Leverage Tanstack Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
Manage global state with Zustand instead of Context API.
